# Welcome to Classically Punk
***
Classically Punk is a music genre classification project that combines different elements of music to develop a machine learning model that predicts music genre.

In this project, we aim to use machine learning techniques to automatically classify different musical genres, from audio snippets. To achieve this, we will need to find a library that can read music files and extract features from them, such as tempo, pitch, and melody. We will then use these features to train a machine learning model that can classify different genres of music.
## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem statement for this project is the difficulty in manually classifying large collections of music into different genres. This process can be time-consuming and prone to errors, as it requires a deep understanding of the characteristics of each genre. Furthermore, as the amount of music available online continues to grow, it becomes increasingly challenging to keep up with the task of categorizing music by hand. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning application that can automate the process of music classification, making it faster, more accurate, and scalable. The application will use features extracted from audio files to train a machine learning model that can classify different genres of music, including Classically Punk, without the need for human intervention.
## Description
How have you solved the problem?
In conclusion, the results of the machine learning models developed for music genre classification suggest that the SVM and KNN models perform better than the Kmeans model. Both the SVM and KNN models have higher F1-scores, precision, and recall than the Kmeans model, indicating better performance in predicting the different music genres, including Classically Punk. This implies that the developed machine learning application can automate the process of music genre classification, making it faster, more accurate, and scalable. The application can extract features from audio files and train an SVM or KNN model to classify music into different genres without the need for human intervention. However, further analysis is necessary to confirm the generalizability of the models to other datasets, and hyperparameter tuning may be required to optimize the performance of the models. Overall, the developed machine learning application has the potential to revolutionize the music industry by streamlining the process of music genre classification.
