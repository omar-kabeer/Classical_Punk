    "The problem statement for this project is the difficulty in manually classifying large collections of music into different genres. This process can be time-consuming and prone to errors, as it requires a deep understanding of the characteristics of each genre. Furthermore, as the amount of music available online continues to grow, it becomes increasingly challenging to keep up with the task of categorizing music by hand. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning application that can automate the process of music classification, making it faster, more accurate, and scalable. The application will use features extracted from audio files to train a machine learning model that can classify different genres of music, including Classically Punk, without the need for human intervention."

    "In conclusion, the results of the machine learning models developed for music genre classification suggest that the SVM and KNN models perform better than the Kmeans model. Both the SVM and KNN models have higher F1-scores, precision, and recall than the Kmeans model, indicating better performance in predicting the different music genres, including Classically Punk. This implies that the developed machine learning application can automate the process of music genre classification, making it faster, more accurate, and scalable. The application can extract features from audio files and train an SVM or KNN model to classify music into different genres without the need for human intervention. However, further analysis is necessary to confirm the generalizability of the models to other datasets, and hyperparameter tuning may be required to optimize the performance of the models. Overall, the developed machine learning application has the potential to revolutionize the music industry by streamlining the process of music genre classification."

    "Based on the problem statement and the results obtained from the machine learning models, here are some recommendations that could help to further improve the music genre classification application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Augmentation: To improve the performance of the machine learning models, it may be helpful to augment the training data by adding variations of the existing data. This can be done by applying audio effects such as pitch shifting, time stretching, or adding noise to create a more diverse training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering: Feature engineering involves selecting and extracting meaningful features from audio files to train the machine learning model. By experimenting with different audio features and selecting the most informative ones, the performance of the machine learning model can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensemble Learning: Ensemble learning involves combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve the overall performance. By training multiple models using different algorithms or hyperparameters and combining their predictions, the overall accuracy of the application can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. User Feedback: Collecting feedback from users of the application can help to improve the accuracy of the machine learning model over time. By allowing users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the classification results, the application can learn from its mistakes and continuously improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Continuous Monitoring: It is important to continuously monitor the performance of the machine learning model to ensure that it is accurately classifying the different music genres. Regularly updating the model with new data and retraining it can help to improve its accuracy and keep up with changes in the music industry."
